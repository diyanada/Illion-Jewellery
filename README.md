Illion Jewellery Website

1 Feature Set
Illion Jewellery is a high end, cultural jeweler site with an emphasis on being part of the brand. It is a standard commercial site with all the classic features. On top of this we are hoping to achieve a real sense of brand engagement through memberships and deals.

4 Mobile
Illion’s brand requires a slick experience on both web and mobile Whilst thinking of this we would like to try a custom UI for Illions mobile experience. One of the signature pieces of Illion’s range is their Illion Pound. A coin shaped gold piece that reflects the brand. I would like to use this as a scrollable wheel to cycle the menu. As it is a small menu it shouldn’t feel too clunky. This is detailed in the Design Steer documents.
5 Data
For the site to operate, we need to build a backend system to upload and manage products and all images on the site, as well as user details. For this I would like the backend system to work as such.
	1. By Pages
		a. Homepage_
		b. Heritage_
		c. Custom_
		d. Collection_
		e. Basket_
	2. Then By Feature on that Page for example
		a. Custom_ImageGrid_Topleft
		b. Custom_ImageGrid_Topright
		c. Custom_TextBox
		d. Collection_Men_Ring_03_image
		e. Collection_Men_Ring_03_Description
		
6 Marketing
Illion want to be able to email out to their customers, sharing special offers and such. To do this we will need a consent box upon registration and a toggle switch in the account section.
Illion would also like to capture the customer purchasing data and be able to extract that report from the back end. To help with their email campaigns.

7 Overview

This site is a simple transactional site, with added animations and features that set it apart from its competition and seemingly add value to brand. It is imperative that the site oozes luxury, whilst also creating a movement. Similar to how Ed Hardy did back in the early 00’s. The website needs to be an extension of there ethos. “Whether or not you’re a Millionaire, a Billionaire or a Trillionaire. Everyone can be a illionaire!”
Remember that this has to be High fashion. The images we have are only placeholder at the moment. But it will give a general sense, before the product is shipped here for sale.
