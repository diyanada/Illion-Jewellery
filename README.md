Illion Jewellery Website

1 Feature Set
Illion Jewellery is a high end, cultural jeweler site with an emphasis on being part of the brand. It is a standard commercial site with all the classic features. On top of this we are hoping to achieve a real sense of brand engagement through memberships and deals.

2 Menu Structure
The menu wants to be quite light on Illion, so we are choosing to have 3 sections within the menu
        1. Heritage (about page)
        2. Collection (the tab to browse the jewellery)
        3. Custom (to send request for custom pieces)
On top of that we have additional sections which can be reached in different methods.
        1. Basket (icon at the top right)
        2. Account (icon top right of page)
